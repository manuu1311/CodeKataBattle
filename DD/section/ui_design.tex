In the Educator Interface the main page shows the ongoing tournaments, followed by every ongoing battle for that tournament. \\The search bar allows educator to search for a nickname and find users associated to it, so that it's possible to visualize their profile. \\The main functions an educator can perform are shown on the left column: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manage Tournaments}: allows an educator to create and close a tournament, create (with all the possible settings) and close battles and eventually grant the permission to create battles to another educator.
    \item \textbf{Create Project}: allows an educator to create a new project to assign to students. 
    \item \textbf{Create Badge}: allows an educator to create a new badge that could be achieved by the students in a tournament.
